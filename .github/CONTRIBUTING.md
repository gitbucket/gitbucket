# Guideline for Issues

- At first, See [FAQ](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki/FAQ) and check issues whether there is a same question or request in the past.
- If you can't find same question and report, send it to [gitter room](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket) before raising an issue.
- We can also support in Japaneses other than English at [gitter room for Japanese](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket_ja).
- Write an issue in English. At least, write subject in English.
- First priority of GitBucket is easy installation and reproduce GitHub behavior, so we might reject if your request is against it.
