# The guidelines for contributing

- At first, see [Wiki](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki) and check issues and pull requests whether there is a same request in the past.
- The highest priority of GitBucket is the ease of installation and API compatibility with GitHub, so your feature request might be rejected if they go against those principles. If you don't wanna waste your time to make a pull request, ask us about your idea at [gitter room](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket) before starting your work.
- You can edit the GitBucket documentation on Wiki if you have a GitHub account. When you find any mistakes or lacks in the documentation, please update it directly.
- All your contributions are handled as [Apache Software License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/blob/master/LICENSE). When you create a pull request or update the documentation, we assume you agreed this clause.
