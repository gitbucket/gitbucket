Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Github clone [GitBucket 2.1](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/releases/tag/2.1)!

This release does not have no major feature but it contains many bug fix and improvements. Important topics in this release are below:

## Upgrade Slick to 2.0 from 1.9

Slick 2.0 contains many API changes. This is a first step to upgrade to Scala 2.11. We will try to upgrade frameworks and libraries other than Slick in the next version.

## Base part of plug-in system

The base part of plug-in system has been merged. Plug-ins management UI is not provided in this version. Therefore you can't install plug-ins actually but it will be possible in the future version.

See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/issues?milestone=18&state=closed) to know details. 

Enjoy GitBucket!
