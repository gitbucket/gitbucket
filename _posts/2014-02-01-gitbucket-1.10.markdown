- Change default data directory to `HOME/.gitbucket` from `HOME/gitbucket`, but if data directory already exist at `HOME/gitbucket`, it continues being used.
- Add LDAP display name attribute
- Response performance improvement

Running GitBucket is very easy:

1. Download gitbucket.war from [here](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/releases/tag/1.10) and hit `java -jar gitbucket.war` in console
2. Access `http://localhost:8080/` by your browser

And also some bugs are fixed in this release. Please upgrade your GitBucket, it's also very easy. You have to only replace gitbucket.war.

Enjoy!
