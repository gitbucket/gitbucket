Today, we are pleased to announce the availability of new version of Scala based Github clone [GitBucket 2.3](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/releases/tag/2.3)!

## Scala based plugin system

The plugin system is available since GitBucket 2.2, but it had been still experimental in 2.2.

In GitBucket 2.3, the plugin system moved to Scala based. We also provide some plugin examples include code snippet management system like Gist.

However the plugin system is not still so stable and API for plugins is not enough. Note large changes in the future release.

## Embedded Jetty extraction directory

Embedded Jetty extracts war file into `/tmp` in Linux. However `/tmp` is cleaned by operating system periodically. It causes error.

In GitBucket 2.3, it extracts into `GITBUCKET_HOME/tmp` to solve this issue.

In addition, some bug fix and improvements are contained in this release. See [all closed issues in this release](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/issues?q=milestone%3A2.3+is%3Aclosed) to know details.

Enjoy GitBucket!
