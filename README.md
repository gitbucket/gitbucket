If you want to try the development version of GitBucket, see the documentation for developers at [Wiki](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/wiki).

Installation
--------

1. Download latest **gitbucket.war** from [the release page](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/releases).
2. Deploy it to the Servlet 3.0 container such as Tomcat 7.x, Jetty 8.x, GlassFish 3.x or higher.
3. Access **http://[hostname]:[port]/gitbucket/** using your web browser.

If you are using Gitbucket behind a webserver please make sure you have increased the **client_max_body_size** (on nignx)

The default administrator account is **root** and password is **root**.

or you can start GitBucket by `java -jar gitbucket.war` without servlet container. In this case, GitBucket URL is **http://[hostname]:8080/**. You can specify following options.

- --port=[NUMBER]
- --prefix=[CONTEXTPATH]
- --host=[HOSTNAME]
- --gitbucket.home=[DATA_DIR]

To upgrade GitBucket, only replace gitbucket.war. All GitBucket data is stored in HOME/.gitbucket. So if you want to back up GitBucket data, copy this directory to the other disk.

For Installation on Windows Server with IIS see [this wiki page](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/wiki/Installation-on-IIS-and-Helicontech-Zoo)

### Mac OS X
#### Installing Via Homebrew

```
$ brew install gitbucket
==> Downloading https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket/releases/download/1.10/gitbucket.war

==> Caveats
Note: When using launchctl the port will be 8080.

To have launchd start gitbucket at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/gitbucket/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load gitbucket now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.gitbucket.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    java -jar /usr/local/opt/gitbucket/libexec/gitbucket.war
==> Summary

```

#### Manual Installation

Run the following commands in `Terminal` to

- start gitbucket: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/gitbucket.plist`
