You can try an [online demo](https://gitbucket.herokuapp.com/) *(ID: root / Pass: root)* of GitBucket, and also get the latest information at [GitBucket News](https://gitbucket.github.io/gitbucket-news/).

Features
--------
The current version of GitBucket provides many features such as:

- Public / Private Git repositories (with http/https and ssh access)
- GitLFS support
- Repository viewer including an online file editor
- Issues, Pull Requests and Wiki for repositories
- Activity timeline and email notifications
- Account and group management with LDAP integration
- a Plug-in system

Installation
--------
GitBucket requires **Java8**. You have to install it, if it is not already installed.

1. Download the latest **gitbucket.war** from [the releases page](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/releases) and run it by `java -jar gitbucket.war`.
2. Go to `http://[hostname]:8080/` and log in with ID: **root** / Pass: **root**.

You can also deploy `gitbucket.war` to a servlet container which supports Servlet 3.0 (like Jetty, Tomcat, JBoss, etc)

For more information about installation on Mac or Windows Server (with IIS), or configuration of Apache or Nginx and also integration with other tools or services such as Jenkins or Slack, see [Wiki](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki).

To upgrade GitBucket, replace `gitbucket.war` with the new version, after stopping GitBucket. All GitBucket data is stored in `HOME/.gitbucket` by default. So if you want to back up GitBucket's data, copy this directory to the backup location.

Plugins
--------
GitBucket has a plug-in system that allows extra functionality. Officially the following plug-ins are provided:

- [gitbucket-gist-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-gist-plugin)
- [gitbucket-emoji-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-emoji-plugin)
- [gitbucket-pages-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-pages-plugin)
- [gitbucket-notifications-plugin](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket-notifications-plugin)

You can find more plugins made by the community at [GitBucket community plugins](https://gitbucket-plugins.github.io/).

Building and Development
-----------
If you want to try the development version of GitBucket, or want to contribute to the project, please see the [Developer's Guide](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/blob/master/doc/readme.md).
It provides instructions on building from source and on setting up an IDE for debugging. 
It also contains documentation of the core concepts used within the project.

Support
--------

- If you have any questions about GitBucket, see [Wiki](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki) and check issues whether there is a same question or request in the past.
- If you can't find same question and report, send it to our [Gitter room](https://gitter.im/gitbucket/gitbucket) before raising an issue.
- The highest priority of GitBucket is the ease of installation and API compatibility with GitHub, so your feature request might be rejected if they go against those principles.
